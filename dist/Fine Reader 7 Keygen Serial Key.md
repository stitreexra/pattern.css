If you want to use ABBYY FineReader 7.0 without any limitations, you need to activate it with a valid serial number. However, if you don't have one or you lost it, you can try to generate one using a keygen serial key program. A keygen is a software that can create random serial numbers for various software applications.
 
However, before you use a keygen serial key program, you should be aware of the risks and disadvantages of doing so. First of all, using a keygen serial key program is illegal and unethical, as it violates the software license agreement and infringes the intellectual property rights of the software developer. Secondly, using a keygen serial key program can expose your computer to malware, viruses, and other security threats, as some keygens may contain malicious code or download unwanted programs. Thirdly, using a keygen serial key program can result in activation failure, as some serial numbers may be invalid, expired, or already used by someone else.
 
Therefore, we strongly recommend that you purchase a genuine serial number from ABBYY official website[^1^] [^2^] or contact their customer support if you have any issues with your serial number. This way, you can enjoy the full features and benefits of ABBYY FineReader 7.0 without any risks or problems.
